### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Scientist, who graduated from the University of Havana in Cuba. I currently work as an IT systems administrator at the same university.

I really like the Go language, Docker, and all the things about distributed systems.

I recently started to learn more about blockchain, DeFi, DApps and all the Ethereum ecosystems, with the goal of becoming a Web3 developer.

I'm looking to collaborate on any fun and interesting project about Web3.
